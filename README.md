Nefatavl

The first game I've made with Unity. It's done in collaboration with Mikko Raussi and Onni Kyt√∂nummi during our first year at Kymenlaakso University of applied science.

HOW TO RUN: Download and open Nefatavl-master and run NefatavlProto.exe

HOW TO PLAY: All of the game is controlled with the mouse, click the How to play for the rules of Nefatavl itself.

GOAL: This is a versus game, so it requires two local players for optimal experience (since we weren't experienced enough to create an AI opponent). The point is for the defending player to get their King (the unique piece in the middle of the board) to any corner square) while the Attacking player tries to kill the King.

DESCRIPTION: A Unity game made by a three man team with the combined Unity experience of 0 minutes at the start of the project. As this was to be our first proper (or "proper") game ever, we decided to go with something as simple as possible and a board-game adaptation was the first thing to come to mind.
